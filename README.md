# DFS
Depth-First Search (DFS) is a fundamental algorithm used for traversing and searching through data structures like trees and graphs. It starts at a given node, explores as deep as possible along each branch, and then backtracks when it reaches a dead end. In maze solving, DFS systematically explores paths until it finds the exit, making it a practical approach for navigating complex structures.

If we take this sample of 10 X 10 maze having multiple solutions
<pre>
1S00000111
1011010111
1001010001
1011010111
1010010001
1010110111
1010000001
1000110111
010000000E
1111111111
</pre>

The output will be different for each order 

If the order is Down, Right, Up, Left

<pre>
1 S 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 
1 * 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1
